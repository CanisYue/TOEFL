The authorities at secondary schools must make very important decisions regarding what will be considered to be required curriculum for their students. I believe that art and music should be part of this required curriculum.

Studying art and music makes a person more diverse and thoughtful. When one studies art and music, one is exposed to many different cultures and points of view. It allows the audience to perceive the world through a different set of eyes. It is also an excellent way to spark interest in other cultures and diverse ways of life. This promotes understanding and tolerance of others. It is also a porthole to peer into areas of many cultures, including one's own, that one would not readily have access to. This includes everything from social life to metaphysics to philosophy, etc.

Furthermore, these subjcts give the students an outlet for expressing their turbulent emotions during puberty. Art and music are also an excellent way to express emotions. In ancient times, many a troubled man turned to brush work or Chinese classical music to work out difficulities with life. Students of today's modern world have similar issues with life, and need an outlet to express these. Art and music, in any form, can assist one in dealing with personal issues. 

In addition, viewing art and listening to music are excellent ways to relax. When I am stressed because of life, one of my favorite activities is painting while listening to my preferred music. I find this activity to be very soothing and calming. Looking at works of art can have a similar effect, and when one understands the philosophy behind the work, it is that much more beneficial.
