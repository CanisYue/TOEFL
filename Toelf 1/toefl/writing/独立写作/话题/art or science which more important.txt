When asked for the most important subject, different people have different views. I think that these academic subjects are equal to each other: one is not better or more important than the other. First of all, it is important for students to take the classes which they will excel at. If all students were to take history aned literature, half of them would do terribly. Not all students have a literary mind, in fact, only about half of them do. Having a scientifically based mind is no better or worse than the alternative.

It's hard to imagine that all the students are learning history and literature while no one study science and mathematics. If this was the case, a major portion of the world's knowledge would be lost. Science and mathematics students are constantly making important breakthroughs in their fields of research. If the nuber of students taking these subjects dramatically dropped because they were told it was less important than other subjects, this research would come to a grinding halt. Science and mathematics students come up with much of the theories behind how the world works, which are vastly important to society.

In fact, students should be encouraged to take all subjects because there is no way of measuring which courses are "better" than others. Everything a person can study has its own unique value. Whether this value is based on personal beliefs or the beliefs of society at large, everything is important in some way or another. Moreover, most academic disciplines are in fact interrelated. For example, historians sometimes have to employ some statistical knowledge while they are doing their research. At the same time, computer programmers will have a better understading of their field if they are familiar about the history of computer science.
