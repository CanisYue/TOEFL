In this competitive society, college and university students tend to make most use of their vacation. While there are people who suggest students to take a course that has no direct connection to their majors, others hold the view that students should take part in volunteering. As far as I am concerned, the latter idea is more beneficial for students.

First and foremost, just for the simple reason that students have already been frustrated after experiencing a semester's studying and taking an ocean of final exams, it is absurd to require them to take another course in their break. As in many students' view, the long break between semesters means totally away from books and study, they will be reluctant to return to school and take the course. It can be imagine how students will behave during the class under this circumstance. 

Moreover, university is not a place where students who study there are only capable of enhaning there academic ability, but a place students develop themselves in all aspects, including cultivating their social responsibility. As most of the students seldom have time to do good of society during the semesters due to their full schedule, it is an excellent opportunity for them to do it during the long holiday. 

In a nutshell, students can benefits more from the activities of volunteering, for it not only benefit the local, but also develop the students in a different way.
